Solo Project Tips:

It is more important to complete the project than it is to add features since completion is require before you can advance to the Voyage Project.
Concentrate on completing the requirements for your tier and then add bonus features if time permits. Keep in mind that advancing to the Voyage phase of the Cohort depends on the completion of the requirements listed in the project descriptions below.
Choose a tools you are comfortable and productive with. In the limited time available to complete the Pre-Work it's not a good idea to try to use something you aren't already familiar with.

Remember that your app should run error-free. There should be no errors in the browser or server console logs.
You should deploy your app to a server accessible from the Internet for testing, demonstration, and to allow the Chingu-X team to evaluate it at the end of the Pre-Work phase.
